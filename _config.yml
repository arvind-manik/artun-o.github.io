          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Python</mark> and to have a hands-on experience at algorithm trading. 
          
          The app is not mature yet that I'd risk my portfolio on this but I'm planning on making it reliable enough to be a screener.

          I had worked on this as a POC for a work project. 
          
          This uses the <mark>LibSignal</mark> JS protocol (https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-javascript) for truly anonymous forward-secret IM. 
          
          Plan to add more features to this in the future to make a full fledged serverless chatroom.

            I'm working here currently as a full stack developer on Zoho's collaborative
            chat application Cliq. My responsibilities here include, end-to-end module
            development, platform integrations, REST API development, data modeling,
            microservice migrations to name a few.
            
            I also actively manage the backend for a mobile-first consumer chat
            application with end-to-end encryption that we're building currently.
